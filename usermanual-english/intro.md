# Introduction

Welcome to Clock – the time sheet app for student and graduate research assistants \("Hilfskräfte" or "HiWis"\) at Goethe University. This brief manual will answer most of your questions about our app. 

If you have any further questions, feel free to use the feedback form in the app to contact us or simply write an E-Mail to clock-kontakt@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de

## What is Clock?

The web application Clock is a tool for student and graduate research assistants \(Hilfskräfte, "HiWis"\) at Goethe University, designed to help you manage your Working Time Account in accordance with German Minimum Wage Law \(Mindestlohngesetz, MiLoG\) – or simply put: to help you complete your monthly due Time Sheets in a legally recognized way.

Clock is an official alternative to the old Excel-Sheet which is not very comfortable to use - and does not work well for non-Excel users.

## What can Clock do for me?

A great deal!

* Clock allows you to record \("clock"\) your working time directly, as with a punch cards on a time clock.
* You may also enter your working time manually, manage and change all your entries afterwards.
* You may schedule regular working hours \(e.g. for tutorials or according to duty charts\) and enter repeating, scheduled shifts.
* Clock reports the current balance of your account back to you – directly on the Dashboard.
* The Calendar View Mode provides an overview of your past / future scheduled working hours.
* Clock is able to manage different student assistant _contracts_, in case you hold more than one position at Goethe University.
* Clock completes the required calculations according to the regulations for Working Time Accounts, \(e.g. carrying over a certain amount of hours into the next month\).
* If all your working times are documented, you can export your time sheet and save it as a PDF.

Of course, you are free to use Clock for your own personal time management, e.g. to document all the times you have been busy studying.

Clock is built around the principle that you, the user, have full control over your data. If your entries do not comply with the regulations concerning Working Time Accounts, you will be notified. However, in most cases, you are free to save the entries nonetheless.

## What is this reporting business all about?

As student assistant or graduate research assistant you are obliged to enter a time report with your department \(i.e. your Institute, Library, Laboratory, Faculty, or other department\) every month. This is due to a legal obligation of the employer according to para. 17, German Minimum Wage Law \(§17 MiLoG\).

The MiLoG was put in place to guarantee that all employees receive the statutory minimum wage and work under legally acceptable conditions. Ultimately, the aim of this mandatory reporting is not to control your work, but rather to control your employer \(i.e. the University\): with the time report, you are able to document that you worked consistently under legally acceptable conditions. Of course, your department can check on your working times, as well, but ultimately, you are the one filing your time report.

The general legal regulations are not always made for what actually happens "on the ground" \(e.g. if you do some of the marking required for your tutorial at night\). However, many student assistants cherish the freedom that a university job provides. And that is what we also intend to support.

## Who are the people behind Clock?

Clock originated as a student project at the "Zentrum Naturwissenschaften", initiated by student-assistant annoyed by the time-sheet requirements. The service is now hosted by the Human Resources Department of Goethe University. Despite this official support and adoption by the University, Clock is designed to be a service _for students by students_: The app was developed from a student perspective, guided by student interests - and students are still involved in the development, operation and maintenance of the app.

Neither your supervisors nor the PersonalServices department can access your data. The "data exchange" between yourself and the University is achieved exclusively by means of your time report – which is a time sheet. Printed on paper. 

Clock does not contain any hidden or clandestine functions: its source code is open and all the software’s functions are publicly accessible and may be examined by everyone \(provided they have the knowledge and expertise\).
