# Feedback

We need your responses in order to...

* ...be able to detect errors that have escaped us so far.
* ...get simple feedback on the actual usage of clock from you, the user.
* ...get an idea whether the service does what it should do and if we need to improve things.
* ...make us happy! Feedback is a reminder that you are using the app - and that's why we built it. On a side note: Positive feedback makes us especially happy... ðŸ˜‰ 

To provide feedback, please use the Feedback Form. You can always find it on the bottom-left corner of the app.

Feedback messages are automatically connected to your HRZ e-mail, so that we can get in touch with you, too. Of course, you may also simply write an e-mail to [clock-kontakt@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:clock-kontakt@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de) or contact us via the University's [Rocket.Chat](https://chat.studiumdigitale.uni-frankfurt.de/channel/clock_user).

That is all you need to know...

...however, if you wish to provide "high quality feedback", here are some hints. It is especially helpful to indicate which type of feedback you are giving us and makes is even more likely that your ideas inspire concrete improvements.

## Feedback "for nerds"

We have 4 categories of feedback:

1. Bug report \(super important!\)
2. Feature request \(super helpful!\)
3. Question \(super smart!\)
4. General \(super awesome!\)

Further details for the individual categories are given below, but here is a short guideline:

* **Bugs** should be reported immediately. Feel free to report minor concerns as well, and in minute detail \(if you can\).
* For **feature requests**, we welcome detailed descriptions. It's okay to write them from a very subjective perspective.
* **Questions** should be asked about anything that is unclear to you.
* **General feedback** is meant to contain critique \(and praise\) â€“ or anything else if you are not sure about which category to use.

We also accept feedback via e-mail: [clock-kontakt@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:clock-kontakt@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de) or via [Rocket.chat](https://chat.studiumdigitale.uni-frankfurt.de/channel/clock_user) \(channel `#clock_user`\).

In case of server errors a window receiving an error report opens automatically. Please use it to inform us about any system errors.

Please include information about your device, especially if you are using a mobile device or a desktop computer or tablet with a large screen. Some elements behave differently depending on screen size.

## 1. Bugs

...are \(evident\) programming errors that need to be corrected as soon as possible.

If a feature of the app does not work as intended: that's a bug, e.g. the display of incorrect times, your Shifts are gone or other strange things happen. Please describe the problem as detailed as possible:

* What action was \(being\) performed when the problem occurred?
* What was supposed to happen / What does not work?

## 2. Feature Request

We have spent a great deal of thought on Clock and its range of functionalities â€“ but we certainly have not thought of everything. If you have any ideas on how to improve Clock and make it even more usable, we are happy to listen to your suggestions! Suggestions may concern new features, special elements of the user interface or a new design altogether. You may use these questions to detail your suggestion:

* What is expected behaviour? In which place do I expect a control element to be?
* Did a function or workflow step confuse me? Does the user experience feel illogical?
* Could anything look better? Which colours are better suited for our purposes?
* Do you have examples of other apps that do look or work nicer? \(Pshaw!\)

{% hint style="info" %}
To build Clock's user interface, we stuck mostly Google's design recommendations \([Material Design](https://github.com/ClockGU/handbook/tree/c6a3efe17c130c71ac14b67706cb399e4d331dfb/en/about.md#Design)\) and several other sophisticated guidelines concerning user interface and interaction. But, needless to say, personal preferences have a role to play here, as well.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Questions

Of course, you may also simply ask a question â€“ and we would like to encourage you to do so! It is often the case that many people come across the same question â€“ so it is a good thing if it is asked at least once. We can put it into our FAQ and answer it once for all our users, or we may use it to improve the app.

In the app, you can find a FAQ section with general questions. Maybe a new question you brought up will be listed there, someday?

## 4. General

Feel free to use general feedback for everything that does not seem to fit any of the other categories. In addition, we would also like to learn if you are content with Clock \(or not\) â€“ this is the best way to tell us.

**Thank you!**
