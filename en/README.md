## Document your working times simply SIMPLE

The project ClockGU provides a software solution \(**Clock**\), to facilitate the management of the Work Time Account (WTA, German: Arbeitszeitkonto, AZK) for student assistants in accordance with the German Minimum Wage Law \(MiLoG\).

In other words: Clock is a comfortable tool to track your working hours and export the monthly due time sheets.

These pages are the official Clock handbook which will be integrated into the app in the future.
